<p>
<b>oxide</b> is a colorscheme that bridges functionality with minimalist aesthetics.
It is built around clarity and restraint, using a deep near-black background, crisp white foregrounds, and soft pastel accents to emphasize structure without visual noise.

oxide is designed with the same principles of balance and readability, using a deep near-black background that adapts well to different environments without changing its character.
</p>

### Design Philosophy

* **Function first**: If a color does not serve a purpose, it does not belong. The palette exists to highlight logic, not to decorate text.
* **Visual Silence**: We prefer a whisper to a shout. High contrast is reserved for data that matters; everything else recedes into the background.
* **Opinionated Minimalism**: We decided what looks good so you don't have to spend three hours tweaking hex codes in a config file.

### Palette

**oxide** keeps it simple with a focused dark theme designed to work in any lighting condition (or lack thereof).

* **Dark**: A deep, void-like background for long sessions and optimal readability.

### Ports

We are currently focused on the tools that matter.

### Contributing

Minimalism doesn't mean stagnation. If you want to port oxide to a new tool, ensure you strip away the excess before submitting. We like PRs that delete more lines than they add.

### Gratitude

This project stands on the shoulders of giants (and very organized people).

* **Oxocarbon**: The spiritual predecessor. It was my favorite scheme, and oxide borrows heavily from its philosophy of uncompromising contrast.
* **Catppuccin**: For proving that a colorscheme repo can actually be organized. We stole their repo structure because it works.
